## Description
Kuku is an app that mimics a cuckoo-clock in a cartoonish style. By default a cuckoo sound is played once every 15 minutes and multiple times according to the hour of the day, accompanied by a message. If this is considered too intrusive, the user can choose to have only the hours indicated by the cuckoo clock.

The minutely alarms are included for testing/showcasing purposes. They are not meant and/or recommended for everyday use.

## Pitch
Always wanted to own a cuckoo clock but couldn't afford one?
Well, bless the marvels of the modern world, you can get one on your Android phone right now. For Free!
