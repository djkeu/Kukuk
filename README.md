## Description
Always wanted to own a cuckoo clock but couldn't afford one?
Well, bless the marvels of the modern world, you can get one on your Android phone right now. For Free!

Kuku is an app that mimics a cuckoo-clock in a cartoonish style. By default a cuckoo sound is played once every 15 minutes and multiple times according to the hour of the day, accompanied by a message. If this is considered too intrusive, the user can choose to have only the hours indicated and omit the 15 minutes alarms.\
Minutely alarms are included for testing/showcasing purposes only.

The 1.3 version of the app is still available on Netlify, https://kuku-klok.netlify.app/ for non-Android systems. Since the current version (2.0.x) is more tailored for Android, it is recommended over the 1.3 version when possible.
