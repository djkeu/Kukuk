## Description
Always wanted to own a cuckoo clock but couldn't afford one?
Well, bless the marvels of the modern world, you can get one on your Android phone right now. For Free!

Kuku is an app that mimics a cuckoo-clock in a cartoonish style. By default a cuckoo sound is played once every 15 minutes and multiple times according to the hour of the day, accompanied by a message. If this is considered too intrusive, the user can choose to have only the hours indicated and omit the 15 minutes alarms.\
Minutely alarms are included for testing/showcasing purposes only.

    - Kotlin road: coroutines
    - Use of CoPilots

For the poor souls who don't have an Android device, the [1.3] version of the app is available on Netlify at `https://kuku-klok.netlify.app/`. [`ToDo:`] Although the interface hasn't changed much, the current version [2.0.x] is specifically tailored for Android and has several improvements under the hood and is therefore recommended over the [1.3] version when possible.
