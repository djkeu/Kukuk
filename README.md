## Description
Kukuk is an app for Android that mimics a cuckoo-clock. By default a cuckoo sound is played once every 15 minutes and multiple times according to the hour of the day, accompanied by a message. If this is considered too intrusive, the user can choose to have only the hours indicated by the cuckoo clock.

Minutely alarms are included for testing/showcasing purposes.

## Pitch
Always wanted to own a cuckoo clock but couldn't afford one?
Well, bless the marvels of the modern world, you can get one on your Android phone right now. For Free!
