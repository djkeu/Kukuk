# Kukuk - a digital cuckoo clock

## Pitch
Always wanted to own a cuckoo clock but couldn't afford one?
Well, bless the marvels of the modern world, you can have one on your phone right now. For Free!

## Description
Kukuk mimics a cuckoo-clock, in which a cuckoo sound and a message indicate the hour of the day. On top of that, every quarter of an hour the cuckoo sound and message are played once. The user can opt to have only the hours indicated and skip the quarterly alarms.

Minutely alarms are included for testing/showcasing purposes only and are not recommeneded for everyday use.
