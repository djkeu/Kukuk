## 1. Description
### Pitch
Always wanted to own a cuckoo clock but couldn't afford one?
Well, bless the marvels of the modern world, you can get one on your Android phone right now. For Free!

### Actual description
Kuku is an app that mimics a cuckoo-clock in a cartoonish style. By default a cuckoo sound is played once every 15 minutes and multiple times according to the hour of the day, accompanied by a message. If this is considered too intrusive, the user can choose to have only the hours indicated and omit the 15 minutes alarms.

Minutely alarms are included for testing/showcasing purposes only. See `3. Disclaimer` if you insist on using it for any other purposes as those just stated.


### Roads
- Why
- Journey
    - Python road
    - Kotlin road: coroutines
    - Use of CoPilots


### Odds and ends
For the poor souls who don't have an Android device, the [1.3] version of the app is available on Netlify at `https://kuku-klok.netlify.app/`. [`ToDo:`] 

The current version [2.0.x] is specifically tailored for Android and has several improvements under the hood and is therefore recommended over the [1.3] version when possible.
